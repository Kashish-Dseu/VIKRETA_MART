# VIKRETA_MART
<p>Vikreta Mart is a web application designed to streamline the business interactions between vendors and suppliers in a user-friendly and efficient manner. Upon visiting the site, users are welcomed by a clean interface offering login and registration options specifically tailored for vendors and suppliers. Vendors can access features focused on purchasing, order management, and community engagement, including a dashboard for tracking recent orders, viewing verified suppliers, joining collective bulk orders, and staying updated with price changes and announcements. Suppliers, on the other hand, benefit from tools centered on order fulfillment, catalog management, business profile maintenance with FSSAI verification, and analytics for sales tracking. Both user roles share common functionalities such as a bilingual, context-aware chatbot for real-time assistance in English and Hindi, and persistent navigation elements for seamless movement throughout the site. The website structure emphasizes role separation to provide targeted features while maintaining consistency through shared components, ensuring a streamlined, collaborative, and accessible experience for all users.
